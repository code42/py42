`py42` is a Python wrapper around the Code42 REST APIs that also provides several other useful utility methods.
It is designed to be used for developing your own tools for working with Code42 data while avoiding the overhead
of session / authentication management.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7.x or 3.5.0+
- Code42 Server 6.8.x+ or cloud environment (e.g. console.us.code42.com or crashplan.com)

## Installation

Run the `setup.py` script to install the py42 package and its dependencies on your system.
You will likely need administrative privileges for this.

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

## Hello, py42

Here's a simple example to verify the installation and your server/account.

Launch the Python interpreter

```bash
$ python
```

Import a couple essentials

```python
>>> import py42.sdk
>>> import py42.sdk.util as util
```

Initialize the client.

```python
>>> sdk = py42.sdk.from_local_account("https://console.us.code42.com", "john.doe", "password")
```

Get and print your user information.

```python
>>> response = sdk.users.get_current()
>>> util.print_response(response)
```

You should see something like the following:

```json
{
    "username": "john.doe",
    "orgName": "ACME Organization",
    "userId": 123456,
    "emailPromo": true,
    "licenses": [],
    "modificationDate": "2018-08-29T15:32:56.995-05:00",
    "blocked": false,
    "usernameIsAnEmail": true,
    "userUid": "1234567890abcdef",
    "userExtRef": null,
    "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
    "status": "Active",
    "localAuthenticationOnly": false,
    "orgUid": "123456789123456789",
    "passwordReset": true,
    "active": true,
    "creationDate": "2012-01-16T11:25:43.545-06:00",
    "orgType": "BUSINESS",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "notes": null,
    "orgId": 123456,
    "quotaInBytes": -1,
    "invited": false
}
```


## Configuration

There are a few default settings that affect the behavior of the client.

| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| verify_ssl_certs | Controls whether the SDK verifies the server's certificate.<br>Possible values: `True`, `False`, or a path to a CA bundle to use.| `True`
| proxies | Dictionary mapping protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy.<br>See [the Requests library's documentation on proxies](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/?highlight=proxies#proxies) for more info.| `None`
| debug.level | Controls print statements for debugging | `py42.sdk.settings.debug.NONE`
| items_per_page | Controls how many items are retrieved per request for methods that loops over several "pages" of items in order to collect them all. | 1000

To override these settings, import `py42.sdk.settings` and override values as necessary before creating the client.
 For example, to disable certificate validation in a dev environment:

```python
import py42.sdk
import py42.sdk.settings as settings

settings.verify_ssl_certs = False
sdk = py42.sdk.from_local_account("https://console.us.code42.com", "my_username", "my_password")
```

## Usage

The SDK object opens availability to APIs across the Code42 environment, including storage nodes.

```python
import py42.sdk

sdk = py42.sdk.from_local_account("https://console.us.code42.com", "my_username", "my_password")

# clients are organized by feature groups and accessible under the sdk object

# get information about the current user.
current_user = sdk.users.get_current()

# page through all devices available to this user.
for device_page in sdk.devices.get_all():
    for device in device_page["computers"]
        print(device)

# page through all orgs available to this user.
for org_page in sdk.orgs.get_all():
    for org in org_page["orgs"]:
        print(org)

# save a copy of a file from an archive this user has access to into the current working directory.
stream_response = sdk.archive.stream_from_backup("/full/path/to/file.txt", "1234567890")
with open("/path/to/my/file", 'wb') as f:
    for chunk in stream_response.iter_content(chunk_size=128):
        if chunk:
            f.write(chunk)

# search file events
from py42.sdk.queries.fileevents.file_event_query import FileEventQuery
from py42.sdk.queries.fileevents.filters import *

query = FileEventQuery.all(MD5.eq("e804d1eb229298b04522c5504b8131f0"))
file_events = sdk.securitydata.search_file_events(query)
```
