# View or Modify device settings

Use py42 to easily view and update the settings for devices with the `DeviceSettings` and `IncydrDeviceSettings` objects for Crashplan and Incydr customers, respectively.

The [Device Settings](../methoddocs/devicesettings.md) objects are wrappers around the complex nested dict that the Code42 `Computer` API endpoint expects,
providing helper properties that can be used to get/set values, without having to know the underlying nested structure.

To get started, create a `DeviceSettings` or `IncydrDeviceSettings` object for a given device guid.  The `get_settings()` method will create the appropriate object automatically based on the corresponding service running on the device:

```python
device_settings = sdk.devices.get_settings(908765043021)
```

Details on which settings can be updated and which are non-modifiable can be found in the method documentation [Device Settings](../methoddocs/devicesettings.md). These may differ between services.
Some common non-modifiable settings fields are accessible as read-only properties on the object:

```python
>>> device_settings.computer_id
12345
>>> device_settings.guid
908765043021
>>> device_settings.org_id
42
>>> device_settings.user_id
494842
>>> device_settings.version
1525200006800
```

And to change settings, in most cases you can just assign new values to the corresponding attribute:

```python
>>> device_settings.notes
"A note on this device."
>>> device_settings.notes = "A note on this device."
```
The below section provides more detail on managing backup settings for Crashplan customers.

For convenience and logging purposes, all changes are tracked in the `.changes` property of the `DeviceSettings` objects.

```python
>>> device_settings.changes
{'destinations': "{'43': 'PROe Cloud, US <LOCKED>'} -> {'43': 'PROe Cloud, US <LOCKED>', '632540230984925185': 'PROe Cloud, US - West'}"}
```

Once you've made all the desired changes to a `DeviceSettings` object, you can post the changes by passing it to the `sdk.devices.update_settings` method, which returns a `Py42Response` object
with the server response:

```python
>>> sdk.devices.update_settings(device_settings)
<Py42Response [status=200, data={'active': True, 'address': '192.168.74.144:4247', 'alertState': 0, 'alertStates': ['OK'], ...}]>
```


## Crashplan

### Backup settings

The available backup destinations for a device can be found on the read-only `availableDestinations` property:
```python
>>> device_settings.available_destinations
{'632540230984925185': 'PROe Cloud, US - West', '43': 'PROe Cloud, US'}
```

Because device backup settings are tied to a given "Backup Set", of which there could be more than one, the `DeviceSettings.backup_sets`
property returns a list of `BackupSet` wrapper classes that help manage backup configuration settings.

```python
>>> device_settings.backup_sets
[<BackupSet: id: 1, name: 'Primary - Backup Set'>, <BackupSet: id: 298010138, name: 'Secondary (large files) - Backup Set'>]
```

See the [Configuring Backup Sets](backupsets.md) guide for details on managing backup set settings.

### Advanced usage

Because `DeviceSettings` is a subclass of `UserDict` with added attributes/methods to help easily access/modify setting values,
the underlying dict that ultimately gets posted to the server is stored on the `.data` attribute of `DeviceSettings` instances,
and a `DeviceSettings` object otherwise behaves like a normal dict.

If there is a setting that is not yet implemented by py42 as a helper method/attribute, those values can be manually managed
by treating the `DeviceSettings` object as a normal dict.

For example, setting the "backup status email frequency" value to only send every 10 days, via the helper attribute:

```python
>>> device_settings.backup_status_email_frequency_days = 10
```

And doing the same thing by setting the value manually on the underlying dict:

```python
>>> device_settings["settings"]["serviceBackupConfig"]["backupStatusEmailFreqInMinutes"] = "14400"
```

The benefits of the py42 helper attributes/methods is that the values mimic what the Console UI uses (in this case days
vs the minutes expected by the API endpoint), so you don't have to worry about doing conversions yourself. But since
the underlying dict is accessible, you aren't constrained to only what py42 has so far implemented.

```{eval-rst}
.. warning::
    When manually changing values on the underlying dict, those aren't registered in the `.changes` property and thus
    won't be captured in debug logs by the `sdk.devices.update_settings()` method.
```
