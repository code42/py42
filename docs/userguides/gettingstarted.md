## Licensing

This project uses the [MIT License](https://github.com/code42/py42/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Installation

There are different ways to install py42.

### From PyPI

The easiest and most common way is to use `pip`:
```bash
pip install py42
```

If you need to install a previous version of py42, `pip` lets you do that. For example, if you want to install version
0.4.1, you would do this:
```bash
pip install py42==0.4.1
```

Visit the [project history](https://pypi.org/project/py42/#history) on PyPI to see all published versions.

### From Source

Alternatively, you can install py42 directly from its [source code](https://github.com/code42/py42/pull/51/files):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/code42/py42.git
```
When it finishes downloading, from the root project directory, run:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

### From Distribution

If you want create a `.tar` ball for installing elsewhere, run this command from the project's root directory:
```bash
python setup.py sdist
```

After it finishes building, the`.tar` ball will be located in the newly created `dist` directory. To install it, do:
```bash
pip install py42-[VERSION].tar.gz
```

## Authentication

```eval_rst
.. important:: py42 currently only supports token-based authentication.
```

To initialize the `py42.sdk.SDKClient`, you must provide your credentials (basic auth). If you are writing a script,
we recommend using a secure password storage library, such as `keyring`, for retrieving passwords. However, subsequent
requests use JWT authentication.

py42 currently does **not** support SSO login providers or any other Identity providers such as Active Directory or
Okta.

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Debug mode

Debug mode may be useful if you are trying to determine if you are experiencing permission issues. When debug mode is
on, py42 logs HTTP request data to the console. Use the following as a guide for how to turn debug mode
on in py42:
```python
import py42.sdk
import py42.sdk.settings.debug as debug

py42.sdk.settings.debug.level = debug.DEBUG
```

### File an issue on GitHub

If you have found an issue with py42, you can create a *New Issue* at the
[project repository](https://github.com/code42/py42/issues). See this
