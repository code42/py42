# Executing Searches

py42 includes a powerful, flexible query system that allows you to quickly and easily search file events and alerts.
This guide helps you understand the syntax for building queries and executing searches.

## File Event Searches

First, import the required modules and classes and create the SDK:
```python
import py42.sdk
from py42.sdk.queries.fileevents.filters import *
from py42.sdk.queries.fileevents.file_event_query import FileEventQuery

sdk = py42.sdk.from_local_account("https://console.us.code42.com", "my_username", "my_password")
```

You will need to create `query_filter.FilterGroup` objects to conduct searches. Filter groups have a type
(in the form of a class), such as `EmailSender`, and an operator (in the form of a function), such as `is_in()`.
Some example filter groups look like this:
```python
email_filter = EmailSender.is_in(["test.user@example.com", "test.sender@example.com"])
exposure_filter = ExposureType.exists()
ip_filter = PrivateIPAddress.eq("127.0.0.1")
```

There are two operators when building `file_event_query.FileEventQuery` objects: `any()` and `all()`.

`any()` gets results where at least one of the filters is true and `all()` gets results where all of the filters are
true.
```python
any_query = FileEventQuery.any(email_filter, exposure_filter)
all_query = FileEventQuery.all(exposure_filter, ip_filter)
```

For convenience, the `FileEventQuery` constructor does the same as `all()`:

```python
all_query = FileEventQuery(exposure_filter, ip_filter)
```

You can put filters in an iterable and unpack them (using the `*` operator) in a `FileEventQuery`. This is a common
use case for programs that need to conditionally build up filters:
```python
# Conditionally appends filters to a list for crafting a query

filter_list = []
if need_shared:
    filter_list.append(Shared.is_true())
elif need_actors:
    actor_filter = Actor.is_in(["foo@example.com", "baz@example.com"])
    filter_list.append(actor_filter)
query = FileEventQuery(*filter_list)  # Notice the use of the '*' operator to unpack filter_list
```

To execute the search, use `securitydata.SecurityModule.search_file_events()`:
```python
# Prints the MD5 hashes of all the files that caused exposure events where files were moved to an external drive.

query = FileEventQuery(ExposureType.eq(ExposureType.REMOVABLE_MEDIA))
response = sdk.securitydata.search_file_events(query)
file_events = response["fileEvents"]
for event in file_events:
    print(event["md5Checksum"])
```

## Alert Searches

Conducting alert searches is very similar to file event searches. Much of the content for file event searches applies
to alert searches.

To start, import the filters and query object:
```python
from py42.sdk.queries.alerts.filters import *
from py42.sdk.queries.alerts.alert_query import AlertQuery
```

The one difference between constructing alert queries and file event queries is that alert queries require a tenant
ID. You can get the tenant ID from the `sdk.usercontext` object:
```python
# Create a query for getting all open alerts with severity either 'High' or 'Medium'.

filters = [AlertState.eq(AlertState.OPEN), Severity.is_in([Severity.HIGH, Severity.MEDIUM])]
tenant_id = sdk.usercontext.get_current_tenant_id()
query = AlertQuery(tenant_id, *filters)  # Notice the constructor takes the tenant ID first.
```

To execute the search, use the `alerts.AlertClient.search()` method:
```python
# Prints the actor property from each search result

response = sdk.securitydata.alerts.search(query)
alerts = response["alerts"]
for alert in alerts:
    print(alert["actor"])
```
